# QuizMatic
This application was developed as a part of the Modern Application Development I (MAD1) course at IIT Madras. This application serves the purpose of helping users prepare for exams by attempting quizzes. These quizzes are classified according to the chapters they belong to, which further are classified according to their respective subjects. The user can choose the course and the chapter of their own, and opt to attempt the quiz of their choice. The admin controls these quizzes, and has the job of creating, editing and deleting the subjects, chapters, quizzes and their questions as per the requirement. The admin can view the total user attempts, top scorers, subject wise attempts, and can also view individual user statistics. The user also gets insights into their performance across quizzes and subjects.
